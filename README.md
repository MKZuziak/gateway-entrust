## 0. How to run C components as Docker containers

I have commented out some of the bits in Ansible playbooks, which are not that important for us (Playbooks 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, and 1-5) or describe steps that we want to avoid (everything that has to do with running C components as Linux services in Playbooks 2-2, 3-1, and 3-2). Franck's instructions (see below starting from Step 1. Initial Setup) still apply and need to be done to install Docker, copy all required files, install required libraries, and start Prometheus, NodeRed, and MQTT broker as Docker containers on the Raspberry board. This is a one-off procedure, and the three containers can be started as usual using CLI via SSH afterwards.

Next, you SSH into your Raspberry (the default "pi/raspberry" login/password pair should be working) and do the following:

#### To run the Prometheus Exporter, which will be accesible on port 8086 (it is required that the MQTT broker is already running):

   `docker pull rdautov/prometheus:1.0.0`
   
   `docker run --network host rdautov/prometheus:1.0.0`
 
The Prometheus Exporter feeds some CPU temperature values to the Prometheus Broker via MQTT. You can check if it is running by plotting the graph on the Prometheus dashboard (on port 9090).

#### To run the Network Agent:

   `docker pull rdautov/network-agent:1.0.0`
   
   `docker run rdautov/network-agent:1.0.0`

## 1. Initial setup

#### Hardware
The hardware for the gateway is:

* A Raspberry Pi 3 (OR a Compulab IOT-GATE-RPI)
* An Arduino UNO connected via USB
* One or more Ruuvi sensors
* A USB GPS (optionnal)


#### Software

##### Install the latest Raspbian image
 * Raspbian image can be downloaded from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

 * SD card is flashed with image "2020-02-13-raspbian-buster-lite.img" usind dd or [Etcher](https://etcher.io): 
 
   `sudo dd bs=4M if=2020-02-13-raspbian-buster-lite.img of=/dev/sdXXX conv=fsync`

* Enable the ssh server by writing a file called ssh in /boot on the SD card to avoid the need for a keyboard/screen. See https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/1747/starting-ssh-automatically-at-boot-time.

* Add a "wpa_supplicant.conf" file if you want the pi to connect to a wifi instead of using ethernet.
```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=NO
network={
    ssid="WIFI_SSID"
    psk="WIFI_PASS"
    # Protocol type can be: RSN (for WPA2) and WPA (for WPA1)
    proto=RSN

    # Key management type can be: WPA-PSK or WPA-EAP (Pre-Shared or Enterprise)
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK

    # Pairwise can be CCMP or TKIP (for WPA2 or WPA1)
    pairwise=CCMP

    #Authorization option should be OPEN for both WPA1/WPA2 (in less commonly used are SHARED and LEAP)
    auth_alg=OPEN

    # For hidden SSID
    scan_ssid=1
}
```

* Put the SD card in the RPI3, connect Power (and Network) and let it boot.

##### Find the IP address of the Raspberry pi and save it in an Ansible inventory.

 * Use your router DHCP list of connected devices (the hostname is raspberrypi), nmap or similar.
 * Create an the Ansible Inventory file using the following template (replace `GATEWAY_HOSTNAME` and `LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS`).

```yaml
   gateways:
       hosts:
           GATEWAY_HOSTNAME:
               ansible_ssh_host: LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS
       vars:
           ansible_become: yes
           ansible_ssh_user: pi
           ansible_ssh_private_key_file: ./private-files/ssh-private-key
           ansible_ssh_pass: raspberry
```
   
   
Example (file `inventory_lan.yaml`):

```yaml
gateways:
    hosts:
        ENACT001:
            ansible_ssh_host: 192.168.1.170
    vars:
        ansible_become: yes
        ansible_ssh_user: pi
        ansible_ssh_private_key_file: ./private-files/ssh-key-gateway-enact
        ansible_ssh_pass: raspberry
```

##### Install Ansible and its plugins

Ansible is used both for the initial setup of the gateway and for the deployment of the Tellu components.

 * Install Ansible on your local system [following the official instructions.](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-apt-ubuntu)
 * Install the plugins

```bash
   ansible-galaxy install ANXS.hostname
   ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.firewall
   ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.docker
   ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.pip
   ansible-galaxy install dev-sec.ssh-hardening
```

## 3. Initial setup of the gateway 

List the gateways to be setup in an inventory file (for example `inventory_lan.yaml`). The following command will update the OS on the gateway, install all dependencies and setup the configuration for the tellu components.

```bash
   cd ansible
   ansible-playbook -i inventory_lan.yaml 1-initial-provisioning.yaml
```

## 3. Building the code

The code for the different components is in the src directory. For building the code a version number should be provided in `build_version.txt` then can `./build_all.sh`. This will generate C code for all the ThingML components and create a redy to deploy distribution archive in `ansible/releases`.

## 4. Deploying a specific release


* Set the desired version number in `ansible/public-files/gateway_version.yaml` (it must be available in `ansible/releases`)

*  Deploy release using ansible: 

```bash
   cd ansible
   ansible-playbook -i inventory_lan.yaml 2-deploy-software.yaml
```


## 5. Check what is running

* Access the MQTT broker (TCP on port 1883 or websocket on port 9001). All the inter-component communication is visible.
* Access Prometheus UI: http://192.168.1.170:9090/
* Prometeus Exporter: http://192.168.1.170:8086/

## 6. Adding a command to the Arduino:

This commit provides an example to add a basic actuation command to the arduino:

https://github.com/TelluIoT/gateway-enact/commit/cd5f730c5a411faf9b95d60a2135654eb58d3e08

## 7. Having fun with NodeRed
NodeRed is now also deployed via docker on the gateway (http://192.168.1.170:1880/).

A demo flow showing how to send commands to the MQTT broker is in `ansible/public-files/nodered/flow.json`.
